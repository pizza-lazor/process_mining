# Roadmap

This document tracks the major experience upgrades we plan to implement, in order. We update it as each milestone progresses.

## Stage 1 – Story-driven Overview (✅ complete)
- [x] Polish KPI cards and layout so the overview is compact.
- [x] Auto-generate a descriptive summary (log span, top path, bottlenecks, rework hot spots).
- [x] Elevate plain-language guidance (replace Petri net jargon with approachable copy).

## Stage 2 – Variant & Funnel Explorer (✅ complete)
- [x] Add a ranked variant explorer with filterable “happy path” comparison.
- [x] Provide a Sankey/funnel view built from directly-follows counts.
- [x] Enhance the flow map with interactive highlighting, percent tooltips, and legend metadata.

## Stage 3 – Bottleneck Explorer (future)
- [ ] Surface wait-time heatmaps and slowest transition lists.
- [ ] Expand resource workload visuals with backlog/high-load indicators.

## Stage 4 – Case Drill-down (future)
- [ ] Case timeline/Gantt for selected cases.
- [ ] Slice summary panel (duration distribution, rework %, top resources).

## Stage 5 – Alerts & Suggestions (future)
- [ ] Convert conformance/rework diagnostics into actionable recommendations.
- [ ] Optional: exportable PDF/markdown summary.

## Stage 6 – Interactive Flow View (in progress)
- [x] Prototype an arcade-style directly-follows explorer with hover highlights and neon theming.
- [x] Add a multi-model studio showing Petri, BPMN, Markov, and Declare perspectives simultaneously.
- [ ] Build a non-Petri “process flow” visualization with clickable layers.
- [ ] Synchronise flow view selections with other panels.
